A Kotlin Multiplatform library that tells you whether the device is on the
internet and lets you observe changes as they happen, behind one API:

- **iOS 18+, iPadOS 18+, macOS 15+**: Apple's Network framework
  `nw_path_monitor` (via Kotlin/Native cinterop), serving the same code
  path on all three platforms.
- **Android 11+ (API 30)**: `ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback`
  registered against `NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET + NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED`,
  so captive portals correctly register as not reachable.
- **JVM 21+ (desktop / server)**: polling over `java.net.NetworkInterface`.
  Best-effort — the JDK has no validation probe, so captive portals are
  not detected and transport is inferred from interface names.

UI is out of scope — Reachable is the headless `:reachable` KMP module
(CLAUDE.md §1). Each platform app consumes it natively.

`Reachability.shared` is the recommended entry point: a process-lifetime
singleton with no Context plumbing. On Android, the library's bundled
`androidx.startup` initializer attaches it before `Application.onCreate`.
On Apple, first access constructs the `nw_path_monitor` eagerly and starts
observing immediately. The explicit-lifecycle factories
(`Reachability(context)` / `Reachability()`) remain available for tests
and any code that wants per-instance teardown.

Native targets are ARM-only: `iosArm64`, `iosSimulatorArm64`, `macosArm64`,
Android `arm64-v8a`. A `jvm` target (architecture-neutral JVM 21 bytecode)
covers desktop and server JVMs. SKIE bridges the Swift surface — enums
become exhaustive Swift enums, `StateFlow<T>` becomes `AsyncSequence<T>`,
`suspend fun` becomes `async throws`.

## Installation

Reachable publishes to Maven Central. From a Kotlin Multiplatform project,
depend on `:reachable` from `commonMain` — KMP resolves the right per-target
slice (Android AAR, JVM jar, `iosArm64`, `iosSimulatorArm64`, `macosArm64`)
for you:

<!-- x-release-version-start -->
```kotlin
// shared/build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain.dependencies {
            implementation("com.happycodelucky.reachable:reachable:0.15.0")
        }
    }
}
```
<!-- x-release-version-end -->

Android-only and JVM-only consumers depend on the artifact directly:

<!-- x-release-version-start -->
```kotlin
// app/build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    implementation("com.happycodelucky.reachable:reachable:0.15.0")
}
```
<!-- x-release-version-end -->

Pure-Swift apps (no Kotlin toolchain) consume Reachable via Swift Package
Manager instead — a prebuilt, SKIE-enhanced `ReachableKit.xcframework` attached
to each GitHub Release:

<!-- x-release-version-start -->
```swift
// Package.swift — or Xcode: File → Add Package Dependencies…
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/happycodelucky/reachable-kmp.git", from: "0.15.0"),
]
```
<!-- x-release-version-end -->

A companion `reachable-testing` artifact ships `FakeReachability` and the
`withFakeReachability { }` helper — add it as a test dependency at the same
version (Maven Central only; no SPM distribution). See the
[Installation guide](https://happycodelucky.github.io/reachable-kmp/installation/)
for platform floors, the testing artifact, and the local-development
override.

---

## Quick example

```kotlin
// Singleton path — no Context plumbing, no construction boilerplate.
val reachability: Reachability = Reachability.shared
if (reachability.isReachable) {
    // online
}
reachability.status.collect { status ->
    // every state change
}
// close() on .shared is a no-op — the singleton lives for the process.
```

From Swift:

```swift
let reachability: any Reachability = Reachability.shared
```

For explicit-lifecycle needs (tests, per-feature observers):

```kotlin
// Android
val r: Reachability = Reachability(applicationContext)
// JVM (desktop / server) — optional poll cadence, default 5 seconds
val r: Reachability = Reachability(pollInterval = 10.seconds)
// Apple
val r: any Reachability = Reachability()
r.close() // honours close() normally
```

`status.value` for a synchronous read, `status.collect {}` for a reactive
listener, `status.first()` for a one-shot suspend.

---

## Launch sequence — Apple (iOS, iPadOS, macOS)

The same `appleMain` factory covers all three platforms. Use
`Reachability.shared` for zero-setup access:

```swift
import ReachableKit

@MainActor
@Observable
final class ConnectivityModel {
    var status: ReachabilityStatus = ReachabilityStatus.companion.Unknown

    @ObservationIgnored
    private var task: Task<Void, Never>?

    init() {
        // Reachability.shared — process-lifetime singleton, no close needed.
        let reachability: any Reachability = Reachability.shared
        task = Task { [weak self] in
            for await s in reachability.status { self?.status = s }
        }
    }

    deinit { task?.cancel() }
}
```

For explicit-lifecycle code (tests or per-feature observers), use the
top-level factory and call `close()` on teardown:

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    private let reachability: any Reachability = Reachability()

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environmentObject(ConnectivityModel(reachability: reachability))
        }
    }
}
```

`nw_path_monitor` doesn't require any entitlement. The `network.client`
sandbox entitlement on macOS is about the app's own outgoing traffic, not
the reachability check.

---

## Launch sequence — Android

The library bundles an `androidx.startup` initializer that attaches
`Reachability.shared` to the application `Context` automatically during
the `InitializationProvider` ContentProvider pass — before
`Application.onCreate`. No setup required:

```kotlin
import com.happycodelucky.reachable.Reachability

// No Application subclass, no Context plumbing needed.
@Composable
fun ConnectivityBanner() {
    val status by Reachability.shared.status.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    if (!status.isReachable) {
        Text("You're offline")
    }
}
```

If you disable `InitializationProvider` entirely (rare), or need explicit
lifecycle control, use the factory instead:

```kotlin
class MyApp : Application() {
    lateinit var reachability: Reachability

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        reachability = Reachability(applicationContext)
    }

    override fun onTerminate() {
        reachability.close()
        super.onTerminate()
    }
}
```

`android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` is declared in the library's own
`AndroidManifest.xml` and merged into your app at build time. It's a
normal-protection permission, so no runtime grant is needed.

---

## Launch sequence — JVM (desktop / server)

No Context, no initializer — `Reachability.shared` starts the interface
poll loop on first access, exactly like Apple:

```kotlin
import com.happycodelucky.reachable.Reachability

val reachability = Reachability.shared
reachability.status.collect { status ->
    // re-rendered every time an interface comes up or goes down
}
```

For explicit lifecycle (or a custom poll cadence), use the factory:

```kotlin
import kotlin.time.Duration.Companion.seconds

val reachability = Reachability(pollInterval = 10.seconds) // default 5.seconds
// ...
reachability.close() // stops the poll loop
```

Know the trade-offs on this platform: the JDK offers no validation probe,
so `isReachable` means "a non-loopback interface is up with a routable
address" — a captive portal still reads as reachable. Changes surface
within one poll tick rather than milliseconds, `isDataMetered` is always
`false`, and transport classification is inferred from interface names
(`Transport.Other` when ambiguous — e.g. macOS's `en0`).

## What each platform actually surfaces

|                                  | iOS / iPadOS                       | macOS                              | Android                                 | JVM (desktop / server)                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Reachability backend             | `nw_path_monitor` (satisfied)      | `nw_path_monitor` (satisfied)      | `NetworkCallback` (`INTERNET + VALIDATED`) | `NetworkInterface` polling (best-effort) |
| Captive-portal handling          | OS-internal probe                  | OS-internal probe                  | `NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED`              | **not detected**                        |
| `Transport.Wifi` / `Cellular`    | yes                                | yes                                | yes                                     | best-effort (interface names)           |
| `Transport.Ethernet`             | yes (USB-C / dock adapters)        | yes (`nw_interface_type_wired`)    | yes (`TRANSPORT_ETHERNET`)              | best-effort (`Other` when ambiguous)    |
| `isDataMetered = true`           | `nw_path_is_expensive \|\| nw_path_is_constrained` | `nw_path_is_expensive \|\| nw_path_is_constrained` | `!(NET_CAPABILITY_NOT_METERED \|\| TEMPORARILY_NOT_METERED)` | never (no JDK signal)                   |
| Status seeded synchronously      | no (first emission within tens of ms) | no                                 | **yes** (from `activeNetwork`)          | no (first poll, then every interval)    |

Apple's Low Data Mode signal (`nw_path_is_constrained`) folds into
`isDataMetered` alongside `nw_path_is_expensive`; there's no separate
"Low Data Mode" axis in the public API.

---

## Single-axis shortcuts

The two most-asked questions get dedicated properties so callers don't
unpack `status.value` for a one-line read:

```kotlin
reachability.isReachable      // sync online check
reachability.isDataMetered    // sync metered-path check

reachability.reachable        // StateFlow<Boolean>, conflated, online/offline only
reachability.dataMetered      // StateFlow<Boolean>, conflated, metered/unmetered only
```

The reactive variants are dedicated `MutableStateFlow`s the library
updates synchronously alongside `status` — transport-only changes don't
trigger emissions on `reachable` or `dataMetered`.

---

## Testing support

A companion artifact ships test fakes so consumers can drive
`Reachability.shared` in unit tests without a live platform observer:

```kotlin
// shared/build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonTest.dependencies {
            implementation("com.happycodelucky.reachable:reachable-testing:VERSION")
        }
    }
}
```

Then from any test:

```kotlin
@Test
fun deviceIsOnline() = runTest {
    withFakeReachability(
        initial = ReachabilityStatus(
            isReachable = true,
            transport = Transport.Wifi,
            isDataMetered = false,
        ),
    ) { fake ->
        val vm = MyViewModel()      // reads Reachability.shared
        assertTrue(vm.online)

        fake.setReachable(false)
        assertFalse(vm.online)
    }
}
```

`withFakeReachability` installs the fake as `Reachability.shared`,
runs the block, then uninstalls and closes the fake in `finally` — even
when the block throws. See [Installation](docs/installation.md#testing-support)
for the full dependency snippet and the Gradle coordinate.

---

## Build and test

[`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev) pins JDK, Gradle, Python, `xcodegen`, `gh`,
and the Swift tooling. Bootstrap once per machine:

```bash
brew install mise
mise trust        # accept mise.toml in this checkout
mise install      # provision every tool at the pinned version
```

Then the task surface:

```bash
mise run check          # ktlint + all unit tests (iOS sim, macOS, Android host, JVM)
mise run build:ios      # iOS device + simulator debug frameworks
mise run build:macos    # macOS desktop debug framework
mise run build          # release ReachableKit.xcframework (sample-app local SPM)
mise run build:android  # Android AAR
mise run open:ios       # spm:dev + xcodegen + open apps/ios in Xcode
mise run open:macos     # spm:dev + xcodegen + open apps/macos in Xcode
```

Each task is a thin wrapper over `./gradlew` (or `xcodegen` for the
`open:*` tasks); see [`mise.toml`](./mise.toml) for the exact mapping, or
run `mise tasks` to list everything. Raw `./gradlew` invocations still
work — mise just ensures everyone (and CI) runs the same versions.

For the iOS and macOS sample apps see [`apps/ios/README.md`](./apps/ios/README.md)
and [`apps/macos/README.md`](./apps/macos/README.md).

## Repository conventions

- **Versions** (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`) are the single source of
  truth. Web-search before bumping any dependency (CLAUDE.md §2). Kotlin
  is pinned at the highest version SKIE supports — currently 2.3.20 with
  SKIE 0.10.11.
- Every public method on the Swift-facing surface follows
  CLAUDE.md §8 conventions: `@ObjCName` where the default Swift name is
  awkward, `@Throws` on every `suspend fun` that can throw across the
  boundary.
- `internal` by default; widen visibility only when needed (CLAUDE.md §3).
- DI is a user choice. The primary entry point is `Reachability.shared`
  (zero-setup singleton). For tests or explicit lifecycle, the asymmetric
  platform factories (`Reachability(context)` / `Reachability()`) are also
  public. No DI container is required by the library.

See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for the full project conventions.
