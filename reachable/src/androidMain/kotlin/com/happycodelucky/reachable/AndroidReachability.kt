/*
 * Reachable — Android implementation.
 *
 * Wraps `ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback` registered against a
 * NetworkRequest that requires both NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET and
 * NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED. The `VALIDATED` capability is the only
 * trustworthy "real internet reachable" signal — bare `onAvailable()` will
 * fire for captive-portal Wi-Fi and DNS-blackholed networks too.
 *
 * The class supports two construction paths:
 *
 *   1. `AndroidReachability(context)` — the today/legacy path used by the
 *      public `Reachability(context)` factory. The secondary constructor
 *      delegates to the zero-arg primary and immediately calls [attach].
 *
 *   2. `AndroidReachability()` — the deferred path used by
 *      [com.happycodelucky.reachable.Reachability.shared]. Returns an
 *      instance whose `status.value == ReachabilityStatus.Unknown` until
 *      [attach] is called (typically by the bundled
 *      [com.happycodelucky.reachable.ReachabilityInitializer] during the
 *      `androidx.startup` ContentProvider pass, before
 *      `Application.onCreate`). Splitting construction from attach removes
 *      the "did the consumer build Reachability early enough?" footgun.
 *
 * Min-SDK 30 (CLAUDE.md §1, gradle/libs.versions.toml). NetworkCallback,
 * NetworkRequest, NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED, and the `getSystemService(Class)`
 * overload are all available on API 23+, so no version checks are needed.
