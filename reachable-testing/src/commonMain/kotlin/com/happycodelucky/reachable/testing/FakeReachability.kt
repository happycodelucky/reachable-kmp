/**
 * Scriptable fake [Reachability] for tests.
 *
 * Drives [status] / [reachable] / [dataMetered] through the same
 * [StateFlowReachability] base class as the production Apple / Android
 * implementations, so tests exercise the same conflation and
 * close-after-emit semantics consumers see in production.
 *
 * ### Driving state
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val fake = FakeReachability(
 *     initial = ReachabilityStatus(
 *         isReachable = true,
 *         transport = Transport.Wifi,
 *         isDataMetered = false,
 *     ),
 * )
 * fake.emit(ReachabilityStatus.Unknown)
 * fake.setReachable(false)
 * fake.setTransport(Transport.Cellular)
 * fake.setDataMetered(true)
 * ```
 *
 * The convenience setters compose with the current value —
 * `setReachable(false)` leaves `transport` and `isDataMetered` alone. They
 * publish via the same internal `publish` path so StateFlow conflation
 * rules apply.
 *
 * ### Observing close
 *
 * Unlike the production singleton (which is wrapped in
 * `NonClosingReachability` and no-ops `close()`), this fake **honours**
 * `close()` and counts every call. Tests can assert
 * `assertEquals(0, fake.closeCallCount)` to verify the unit under test
 * does *not* try to close `Reachability.shared`, or assert a positive
 * count to verify a `use { }` block did teardown properly.
 *
 * ### Installing as `Reachability.shared`
 *
 * Use [withFakeReachability] — it constructs a fake, installs it as the
 * shared singleton via `Reachability.installForTesting`, runs your test
 * block, then uninstalls and closes the fake in `finally`.
 *
 * Renames cleanly across the Swift bridge: in Swift the class reads as
 * `FakeReachability`, with `emit(status:)`, `setReachable(_:)`,
 * `setTransport(_:)`, `setDataMetered(_:)`, `reset()`, `closeCallCount`,
 * `wasClosed`.
 *
 * @param initial Seed [ReachabilityStatus]. Defaults to
 * [ReachabilityStatus.Unknown] to match the production StateFlow seed —
 * supplying any other value publishes it during construction so that
 * late-joining collectors immediately observe it instead of seeing
 * `Unknown → initial`.
